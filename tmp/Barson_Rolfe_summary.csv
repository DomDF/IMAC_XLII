# Inference for Stan model: Barson_Rolfe_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(2500,2500,2500,2500); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 10000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (0.10, 0.10, 0.10, 0.10) seconds, 0.41 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.063, 0.059, 0.060, 0.064) seconds, 0.25 seconds total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
