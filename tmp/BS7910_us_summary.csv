# Inference for Stan model: BS7910_us_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(250,250,250,250); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 1000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (0.10, 0.10, 0.10, 0.10) seconds, 0.41 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.0060, 0.0060, 0.0060, 0.0060) seconds, 0.024 seconds total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
