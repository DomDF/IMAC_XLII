# Risk Optimal Material Test Planning using Value of Information Analysis

Value of information analysis is an established statistical method for quantifying how much engineers should be willing to pay for data (of a specified “quality”), in the context of supporting a decision problem. In this paper, an application is detailed concerning pre-commissioning testing requirements.
Toughness is a material property that describes a resistance to damage, particularly cracks. The procedures required to obtain this data are relatively complex and intricate, both in terms of preparation of the specimens, and in performing the measurements.

In many industries this property is indirectly measured using cheaper Charpy V-notch tests. These tests can also be
supplemented with detailed simulation/modelling data.
Standardised guidance still relies on simplified heuristics for understanding the trade-off between quality and quantity of material test data. Here, the use of computational statistics is demonstrated to quantify the expected value of testing programs consisting of different combinations of Charpy and full fracture toughness tests, accounting for the imperfect features of the data and system effects. The code to perform the uncertainty quantification, and optimisation will be made available.

A risk-optimal testing plan is then evaluated alongside alternative approaches. The comparison considers: the required competencies and computation, the interpretability of the results, and the extent to which they support engineering decisions.
